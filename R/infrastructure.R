## Generic Project Directory

This is a generic project template. It might help to add a brief description.

When the project has been created, I recommend running

```usethis::use_github(private = TRUE, protocol = "https")```

to create a private remote repo corresponding to this project. If this project
is edited across multiple machines, it may be necessary to add symbolic links
to data directories using

```ln -s PATH/TO/DATA data```

## Structure
* `code/` is intended to contain all the source R Markdown
files that implement the analyses for the project.
* `data/` will either be a symbolic link to an external data
directory, or a subdirectory.
* `end_products/` will contain the end products of the analysis:
poster presentation, powerpoint, abstract, manuscript, response to
reviewers, etc.
* `notes/` will contain notes on analysis
* `reports/` will contain results exported by the analysis files.
* `scratch/`will contain "scratch paper" code and miscellaneous files.
* `source/` will contain bare scripts (typically containing
functions sourced by the full analysis files)
